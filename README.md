## whatis
This is just a shit code I write while playing Kioptrix 2014 #5. The code here is just a automation in exploitation
using public exploits which I found in the exploit-db. 

The writeup is in my blog, link here


And nope, probably I will never touch this code again, but here is some to do's:
- Pass the payload in clear text and the tool will encode and upload, then decode and execute.
- Put suport for another interpreters, not just perl hardcoded.
- Don't stop hacking.


##### Exploits
